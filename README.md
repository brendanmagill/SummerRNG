## Project 2: Card Picker and Dice Roller

### How to run my code
The page is available [here](https://brendanmagill.github.io/SummerRNG/).

### Motivation
I play a lot of games, including card a dice games, that involve randomization, so this tool can help with those.

### Description
The page has an option to pick a card or roll two dice, and the result is shown in a popup. The cards are chosen with replacement.

### New Skills
- Creating a background image for a page.
- Using javascript to make functions for drawing and rolling.
- Javascript string formatting to display the result.

### Challenges
- String formatting.
- Learning the new syntax of javascript for functions and variables.

### Future Steps
- Create more options like different numbers of dice, different size dice, and drawing multiple cards.
